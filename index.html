        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Sherlock Holmes, a masterful detective and the brainchild of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,
           emerged from the foggy streets of Victorian London. Born to an artistic family, 
           Holmes displayed an early aptitude for observation and deduction, often surprisin
           those around him with his remarkable intellect.</p>
        <p>During his formative years, Holmes honed his skills in various fields, including chemistry, 
           violin playing, and martial arts. His insatiable thirst for knowledge and keen interest in 
           the intricacies of human behavior led him to develop a unique method of investigation.</p>
        <p>Upon meeting Dr. John Watson, a former army doctor, Holmes found a reliable companion who 
           would accompany him on countless adventures. Together, they faced a myriad of challenging
           cases, solving mysteries that ranged from petty thefts to high-stakes criminal enterprises.</p>
        <p>Notable for his enigmatic personality, Holmes was a complex character with a penchant for
           solitude and a dedication to justice. His Baker Street residence, 221B, served as the 
           epicenter of his operations, a place where clients sought his unparalleled skills in
           solving the most perplexing crimes.</p>
        <p>Holmes' legacy extends far beyond the pages of literature, influencing the
           detective genre and inspiring countless adaptations in film, television, 
           and other media. His enduring popularity attests to the timeless appeal
           of character defined by his sharp mind and unrelenting pursuit of truth.</p>

        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>Sherlock Holmes' illustrious career as a detective is marked by a multitude of remarkable achievements and notable cases. His unparalleled deductive reasoning and keen observational skills have solved mysteries that have left Scotland Yard baffled.</p>
        <h3>The Hound of the Baskervilles</h3>
        <p>One of Holmes' most famous cases, "The Hound of the Baskervilles," involved the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville on the desolate moors of Dartmoor. Holmes skillfully navigated through the supernatural rumors and uncovered a web of deception, ultimately revealing the true identity of the culprit.</p>
        <h3>A Scandal in Bohemia</h3>
        <p>In "A Scandal in Bohemia," Holmes successfully outwitted Irene Adler, famously referred to as "the woman," retrieving compromising photographs of a royal client. His ability to anticipate and manipulate situations showcased his mastery in the art of deception.</p>
        <h3>The Sign of Four</h3>
        <p>"The Sign of Four" presented Holmes with a complex case involving stolen treasure, a one-legged man, and a secret pact. Holmes' brilliant deduction not only unraveled the mystery but also led to the retrieval of a stolen fortune and justice for his client.</p>
        <h3>The Adventure of the Speckled Band</h3>
        <p>Another triumph in Holmes' career, "The Adventure of the Speckled Band,"
           involved a seemingly supernatural death and a dangerous exotic animal.

        <li>"Elementary, my dear Watson."</li>

        <li>"You see, but you do not observe."</li>

        <li>"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."</li>
        <li>"My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis."</li>
        <li>"The more bizarre a thing is, the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify."</li>
        <li>"I never guess. It is a shocking habit—destructive to the logical faculty."</li>
        <li>"To a great mind, nothing is little."</li>
